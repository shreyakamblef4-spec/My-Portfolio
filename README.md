# My-Portfolio
A personal portfolio website created to showcase my skills, education, certifications, and learning journey as a B.Sc. AI &amp; Machine Learning student. Built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, this project was developed during my Web Development Internship at CODSOFT and focuses on responsive design and clean UI.
